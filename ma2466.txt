My approach for this assignment was to totally code together with my partner and not split tasks so I
could understand all the parts of the code and how they were working together. 

Pros:
    I understood the game's functionality and functions logic
    SAVES YOU TIME!

There was one part we split into individual tasks, such as I implemented the memento pattern for the caretaker
class that handles redo and undo functionality, and my partner handled the heuristic part. It did take
us individually quite the time and I am unable to comment but if it was beter or for worse but eventually
we did end up needing each others help

I am amazed by my progress in the course and the implementation of a game using such design patterns,
which makes it easier to trace out the design for the whole game and its implementation. I am more excited to
work towards a GUI and extending this project to god powers in SANTORINI. 

In hindsight, the pair programming made the task way more about communication and design, and less about implementation
since the implementation was easy when design and communication were effective.
